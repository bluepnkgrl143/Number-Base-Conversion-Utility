CS 3503 Assignment 1- Number Base Conversion

Author: Paola Di Cesare

Description: My implementation of Owl Tech’s number base conversion utility.

Building Instructions: Started with the methods, and went on to writing the main
 to read file correctly line by line, and processing each line based on the first keyword
 which suggest the method to use.

Technologies Used: Used CLion for programming in C.

Challenges and Future Plans: A bit difficult to change to C language,
structure is similar to Java, however some keywords were tricky, and needed to research.

CS 3503 Assignment 2- Data Representation and Mapping

Author: Paola Di Cesare

Description: Advanced data representation functions for Owl Tech ’s CPU design team .

What ’s New
- Direct mapping functions ( oct/ hex/ bin)
- Signed number representations
- Reused test framework from A1

Building Instructions: Changed main to read both files correctly line by line. Added new methods oct_to_bin,
oct_to_hex hex_to_bin, and to_sign_magnitude, to_ones_complement, and to_twos_compelement.
revised A1 to perform correctly along with new functions. Needed to research more on octal and
hexadecimal in order to implement new methods, debugged and test ran succesfully. Understand the functions
and purpose, but I am dependent of outside help in order to code them properly.

Test Results: All passed after debugging and fixing output in certain methods.
